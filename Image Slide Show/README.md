For this android application you need to place the files "image_slideshow.xml" and other images (i.e. "img_1.jpg", "img_2.jpg", "img_3.jpg" ) in appropiate locations (i.e. floders).
The location is "res/drawable/__mentioned_above_files__". Here "__mentioned_above_files__" means files like "image_slideshow.xml", "img_1.jpg", "img_2", "img_3" so on etc.
